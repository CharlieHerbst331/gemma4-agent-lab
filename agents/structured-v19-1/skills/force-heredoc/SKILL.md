description: Use when patch or repair must write a source edit via run_command. Do not use for localize or triage.

Write and run this helper with run_command. Replace PATH, OLD, NEW from the latest HYPOTHESIS. Keep OLD and NEW free of backslashes and triple quotes. A line break can be \n inside b\"...\". Non-ASCII bytes need \xNN.

```bash
cat > /tmp/line_fix.py <<'EOF'
path = "PATH"
old = b'''OLD'''
new = b'''NEW'''
f = open(path, "rb")
s = f.read()
f.close()
assert s.count(old) == 1
s = s.replace(old, new, 1)
assert new in s
if path.endswith(".py"):
    import ast
    ast.parse(s.decode("utf-8"))
import shutil
backup = "/tmp/pre_" + path.replace("/", "_")
shutil.copyfile(path, backup)
f = open(path, "wb")
f.write(s)
f.close()
if path.endswith(".py"):
    import py_compile
    try:
        py_compile.compile(path, doraise=True)
    except Exception:
        shutil.copyfile(backup, path)
        raise
print(backup)
EOF
python /tmp/line_fix.py
git diff
```

The helper asserts and runs ast.parse before any write. Only after that succeeds it saves this PATH under /tmp, then writes PATH. If python /tmp/line_fix.py fails before that save, PATH was not written. Do not restore it. If py_compile fails, the helper copies that /tmp backup back onto PATH and onto no other file. Do not restore again. One smaller edit is allowed (fewer lines in OLD and NEW). A failed assert or ast.parse must not revert an earlier edit of PATH. Do not run git checkout, except the one repair restore line test -s /tmp/best.diff && git diff > /tmp/repair.diff && git checkout -- . && (git apply /tmp/best.diff || git apply /tmp/repair.diff).

Do not touch protected paths: tests, conftest.py, pytest.ini, pyproject.toml, tox.ini, setup.cfg, test_*.py, *_test.py, or a .py file under tests, test, or testing. Scratch files go under /tmp only.
